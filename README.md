# Offline Virt

## Overview
This project is designed to provide an offline virtual environment to test Operating Systems. The challenge I came across is something that's going to be recurring as companies release new Operating Systems. Not only are new Operating Systems going to be released, there will be updates that mzy change or present a conflict with existing configurations in your environment.  

Along with Operating Systems and their respective updates, there will be hardware options that may not be compatible.

I had a total of one half of a terabyte of empty storage options and wanted to test out features of an enterprise grade OS within a safe environment. 
I didn't need muchspace, considering where we are at with storage availability.  At least that was my mindset when I started. 

## Features
- OS Min  Size Requirements - Some OS's have a 32 bit Version and a 64 Bit Version
  
- Drive Size, I went with a 128GB Drive - Also pay attenton to the speed of your drive and the connection type being used.
  I needed something that I could travel with.
  
- Selection of OS and HyperVisor 

## Installation
1. Windows Enterprise OS - Hypervisor, varies by the different options avaiable. I used VMWare but there are a variety of options available to use.

2. Save to newly selected drive

3. Install the features and software applications wthin your new Virtual OS. 

## Usage
Once you add your baseline of software apps and set network settings. 
You start to see a noticeable size increase. This was something that I expected so there wasn't any suprises. 

* THe one suprise I didn't expect was the first drive I used crashed with plenty of storage space left.
  That's when I realized the crash occurred because of drive speed and the connection being used.  Not because of space.
