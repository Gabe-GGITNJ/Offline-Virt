# Offline Virt

## Overview
This project is designed to provide an offline virtual environment.
I had half of a terabyte of empty storage and wanted to test out a new OS. 
I didn't need much considering where we are at with availability. 

## Features
- OS Min Requirements 
- Drive Size 
- Selection 

## Installation
1. Windows Enterprise OS - Hypervisor, varies by the different options avaiable 
2. Save to newly selected drive 

## Usage
Once you add your baseline of software and set network settings. 
You start to see a noticeable size increase. 

Make sure to select a drive for size and also speed. 
I messed up by using a slower drive. 

It crasahed so I was forced to start with the faster of the two drives
